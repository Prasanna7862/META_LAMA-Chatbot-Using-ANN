# META_LAMA-Chatbot-Using-ANN
The Metalama Chatbot uses Artificial Neural Networks for intelligent, context-aware interactions. With intent recognition, NLU, and dynamic response generation, it enhances customer support, education, and e-commerce. Powered by deep learning and NLP, it offers scalable, human-like conversations with continuous improvement.


Hereâ€™s a guide for running your Metalama Chatbot using Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) on a personal computer and additional information about using the chatbot effectively:


How to Run Metalama Chatbot on Your PC

1. System Requirements:  
   - A computer with a GPU (preferably NVIDIA with CUDA support).  
   - Python 3.8 or higher.  
   - At least 16GB RAM (more is recommended for large models).  
   - Sufficient disk space (model files can require 10GB+).  

2. Installation Steps:  

   a. Clone the Repository:  
   Open your terminal or command prompt and run:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repository-link/metalama-chatbot.git
   cd metalama-chatbot
   ```

   b. **Install Required Libraries**:  
   Use pip to install the necessary dependencies:  
   ```bash
   pip install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu118
   pip install unsloth
   ```

   c. **Set Up the Chatbot**:  
   Ensure you have the right model files and configurations. Update the `model_name` in the code if using a custom or updated version.  

   d. **Run the Code**:  
   Use the following command to execute the chatbot:  
   ```bash
   python chatbot.py
   ```

3. **Using the Chatbot**:  
   - Input your queries in the terminal or a GUI interface if implemented.  
   - Type "exit" to stop the chatbot session.

### **Additional Information about Metalama Chatbot Using ANN**

- **Customization**:  
  You can modify the chatbot's personality by editing the "system" message in the code. For instance, update the assistant's role or the tone of responses.

- **Performance Optimization**:  
  - If you encounter memory issues, disable 4-bit quantization (`load_in_4bit = False`).  
  - Use AMP (Automatic Mixed Precision) for faster inference on supported GPUs.  

- **Potential Applications**:  
  - **Education**: Provide instant answers and explanations.  
  - **Customer Support**: Automate FAQs and troubleshooting.  
  - **Personal Assistant**: Manage tasks, schedules, or act as a conversational companion.  

- **Upgrading Models**:  
  The chatbot uses **Unsloth** for advanced language modeling. Check for new versions of the `unsloth` library and models to enhance capabilities.
